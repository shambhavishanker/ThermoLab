ThermoLab

A Thermodynamic Toolkit

ThermoLab is a small collection of browser based tools designed to make thermodynamics easier to understand.
Instead of only memorising formulas, you can see concepts through simple simulations, calculators, and visualisations.
Everything works offline and is built with beginner-friendly HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. 
Each module kept in its own folder so the code stays easy to follow.

The UI follows a clean, light theme to keep the focus on the science rather than styling. The layout is  simple, so anyone can navigate it within seconds.


- How to Run the Web Version
1. Download the project folder
2. Open index.html in any browser
3. Choose a module from the sidebar or dashboard
4. Explore and interact with the tools


Python Version (Terminal Toolkit):
Alongside the web tools, ThermoLab also includes a full Python CLI version of every module.
This helped us verify the calculations independently and practise writing clear Python code.

- How to run the terminal version:
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Open the project folder in a terminal
3. Run: python main.py
Each module in Python mirrors the logic of the web version.



Included Modules
1. System Classifier
Identifies whether a system is open, closed, or isolated and determines the allowed energy/matter transfers.

2. Ideal Gas vs Real Gas Mapper
Plots Z-factor trends and demonstrates deviations from ideal gas behaviour.

3. Work Calculator
Compares reversible and irreversible expansion work using standard thermodynamic equations.

4. Heat Capacity & Heating Simulator 
Shows temperature rise based on heat input and heat-capacity values.

5. Entropy Simulation
A simple visual mixing model. Particles start separated, begin moving, mix over time, and entropy rises as the progress bar fills.

6. ΔG Spontaneity Studio
Computes Gibbs Free Energy:
ΔG = ΔH – TΔS
and predicts spontaneity using colour-coded results.

7. Hess’s Law Pathway Builder
Combines stepwise enthalpy changes to find overall ΔH, reinforcing the idea of state functions.
